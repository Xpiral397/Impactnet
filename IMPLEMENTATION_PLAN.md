## 📸 HUMAN PHOTOGRAPHY PLAN

### Photos Needed (will use placeholders):

1. **Hero Background** - Community transformation scene
2. **Testimony Cards** (3-4 people):
   - Portrait of Adewale Johnson (Osun)
   - Portrait of Blessing Okonkwo (Oyo)
   - Portrait of Pastor Michael (Osun)
3. **Globe Location Cards**:
   - Osogbo community center
   - Ibadan outreach location
4. **Project Photos**:
   - Water well
   - School program
   - Food distribution

### Placeholder Strategy:
- Use gray rectangles with camera icon
- Add "Photo Coming Soon" text
- Maintain proper aspect ratios
- Easy to replace with real photos

## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

Due to token constraints, I will:

1. Create ONE comprehensive file with ALL redesigned sections
2. Replace all old files at once
3. Test the complete homepage
4. Provide final summary

This approach is most efficient and saves your tokens.

## 📊 TOKEN EFFICIENCY

Current: ~99K/200K used
Remaining work: ~30K estimated

Strategy: Batch all updates into minimal file operations.

**Status**: Ready to proceed with complete professional redesign
**ETA**: 10-15 minutes for all sections
**Result**: $50M enterprise-level homepage
